# Authentication Guards Implementation

## ✅ What was fixed:

### 1. **AuthGuard** (`src/app/shared/guards/auth.guard.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Protects routes that require authentication
- **Behavior**: 
  - Checks if user is authenticated
  - If authenticated: allows access to the route
  - If not authenticated: redirects to `/auth` with returnUrl parameter
- **Improvements**:
  - Added proper TypeScript typing with `ActivatedRouteSnapshot` and `RouterStateSnapshot`
  - Added returnUrl functionality to redirect users back after login
  - Added debug logging (can be disabled by setting `DEBUG = false`)
  - Better error handling and route state management

### 2. **NoAuthGuard** (`src/app/shared/guards/no-auth.guard.ts`)  
- **Purpose**: Prevents authenticated users from accessing auth pages
- **Behavior**:
  - Checks if user is authenticated
  - If authenticated: redirects to `/home` 
  - If not authenticated: allows access to auth/login pages
- **Improvements**:
  - Added proper TypeScript typing
  - Added debug logging (can be disabled by setting `DEBUG = false`)
  - Better route state management

### 3. **AuthService** (`src/app/shared/services/auth.service.ts`)
- **Improvements**:
  - Fixed initialization order issues with BehaviorSubject
  - Better token handling (supports both plain string and JSON-wrapped tokens)
  - Added debug logging throughout the service
  - Added cleanup method for test data
  - Proper authentication state management

### 4. **LoginComponent** (`src/app/shared/components/login/login.component.ts`)
- **Improvements**:
  - Added support for returnUrl parameter
  - After successful login, redirects to the originally requested page
  - Added debug logging for login flow

### 5. **Route Configuration** (`src/app/app.routes.ts`)
- **Re-enabled guards**:
  - `/auth` - protected by `NoAuthGuard`
  - `/reset-password` - protected by `NoAuthGuard` 
  - `/home` - protected by `AuthGuard`

## 🔧 How it works:

### Authentication Flow:
1. **Unauthenticated user tries to access protected route** (`/home`)
   - `AuthGuard` checks authentication status
   - User is redirected to `/auth?returnUrl=/home`
   - After successful login, user is redirected back to `/home`

2. **Authenticated user tries to access auth pages** (`/auth`)
   - `NoAuthGuard` checks authentication status  
   - User is redirected to `/home`

3. **Token Management**:
   - Tokens are stored in localStorage as plain strings
   - AuthService handles both JSON-wrapped and plain tokens for backward compatibility
   - Authentication state is managed through BehaviorSubject for reactive updates

## 🐛 Debug Mode:

All guards and AuthService have debug logging enabled by default. To disable for production:

```typescript
// In each guard/service file, change:
private readonly DEBUG = true; // Set to false for production
```

## 🧪 Testing the Guards:

1. **Test AuthGuard**:
   - Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
   - Try to navigate to `/home` - should redirect to `/auth?returnUrl=/home`

2. **Test NoAuthGuard**:
   - Login with valid credentials
   - Try to navigate to `/auth` - should redirect to `/home`

3. **Test ReturnUrl**:
   - Clear localStorage
   - Navigate to `/home` (gets redirected to `/auth?returnUrl=/home`)
   - Login successfully - should redirect back to `/home`
